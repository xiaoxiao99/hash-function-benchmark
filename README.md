# hash-function-benchmark
A test page to compare performance of several javascript-based hash functions. All libraries are collected from github, including XXHASH, several variants of SHA-1, and MD5
It is also compared with browsers' native digest function for SHA-1,  SHA-256 and SHA-512.

It is uploaded for personal use now. When have time I will clean up the code and add documents.
If you have interest, just watch it and you will get posted when there is any update.

You can play with the demo page at
