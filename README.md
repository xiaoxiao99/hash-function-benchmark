# hash-function-benchmark
A test page to compare performance of several javascript-based hash functions. All libraries are collected from github, including XXHASH and several variants of SHA-1.
It is also compared with browsers' native digest function for SHA-1,  SHA-256 and SHA-512.

It is uploaded for personal use now. When have time I will clean up the code and add documents.
If you have interest, just watch it and you will get posted when there is any update.

Pull requests are always welcome.
